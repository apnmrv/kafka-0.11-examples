# Kafka 0.11 Demo

This repository contains code snippets in Scala, using the Java clients, that demonstrate how to use the Kafka 0.11 new APIs. 
The code is incomplete, and that's intended: the goal is to bring the focus on the new APIs only. 


For more information, you can find the Kafka 0.11 release notes here: https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/0.11.0.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html

# In this Repository

- Idempotent Producer
- Transactional Producer
- Transactional Consumer
- Exactly Once Low Level
- Kafka Admin Client
- Headers on Producer Record (new message type)

# And Kafka Streams?

Kafka 0.11 has exactly once semantics support for Kafka Streams. To learn about it, I'd recommend my other repo:
