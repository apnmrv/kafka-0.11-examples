# Kafka 0.11 Demo

These are a bunch of code snippets in Scala (but using the Java clients) that demonstrate how to use the Kafka 0.11 new features
The code is incomplete, and that's intended. The goal is to bring the focus on the new APIs only. 
You can find the Kafka 0.11 release notes here: https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/0.11.0.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html

# Includes

- Idempotent Producer
- Transactional Producer
- Transactional Consumer
- Exactly Once Low Level
- Kafka Admin Client
- Headers on Producer Record (new message type)

# And Kafka Streams?

Kafka 0.11 has exactly once support for Kafka Streams. To learn about it, I'd recommend my other repo:
